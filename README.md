## Project Overview

The **Data Storage Project** focuses on creating a robust data warehouse using a dataset that captures product sales and returns. This project involves:

- Dimensional modeling for efficient data organization.
- SQL-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to prepare data for analysis.
- Data normalization to ensure data integrity and reduce redundancy.
- Visualization of data using Tableau to derive insights.
- A performance comparison between relational databases (SQL) and graph databases (Neo4j).

This project is ideal for anyone interested in data management, analytics, and visualization.

## Key Features

- **Dimensional Modeling**: Organizes data into fact and dimension tables for easy access.
- **ETL Pipeline**: Automates the data extraction, transformation, and loading processes.
- **Data Normalization**: Cleans and organizes data to eliminate redundancy.
- **Tableau Dashboards**: Visualizes data for better decision-making.
- **Performance Analysis**: Compares the efficiency of SQL databases with Neo4j graph databases.

## Technologies Used

- **Data Management**: SQL, Neo4j
- **ETL Tools**: Python, SQLAlchemy
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Power BI
- **Data Formats**: CSV, JSON
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, Git

## Data Modeling

In this project, we utilize dimensional modeling to create a data warehouse that efficiently stores and retrieves data. The model includes:

- **Fact Tables**: Store quantitative data for analysis. For instance, sales figures and return counts.
- **Dimension Tables**: Store descriptive attributes related to facts. Examples include product details, customer information, and time periods.

The dimensional model enhances query performance and simplifies data analysis.

## ETL Process

The ETL process is crucial for preparing data for analysis. Here‚Äôs how we handle it:

1. **Extract**: Data is pulled from various sources, including CSV files and APIs.
2. **Transform**: Data is cleaned and normalized using Python scripts. This includes handling missing values and ensuring consistent formats.
3. **Load**: The transformed data is loaded into the data warehouse using SQL.

The ETL pipeline automates these steps, making the process efficient and reliable.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is key to understanding trends and patterns. In this project, we use:

- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards that provide insights into sales and returns.
- **Power BI**: To offer additional visualization options.

Visualizations include:

- Sales trends over time.
- Return rates by product category.
- Customer demographics.

These visual tools help stakeholders make informed decisions based on data.

## Performance Comparison

A significant aspect of this project is comparing the performance of relational databases (SQL) and graph databases (Neo4j). We evaluate:

- **Query Performance**: Speed and efficiency of data retrieval.
- **Data Relationships**: How well each database handles complex relationships between data points.

The findings will help determine the best database solution for various data scenarios.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bose234/data-storage-project.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages.
   ```bash
   cd data-storage-project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Dataset**: Get the Product Sales and Returns dataset from the [Releases section](https://github.com/bose234/data-storage-project/releases).

4. **Run the ETL Pipeline**: Execute the ETL scripts to load data into the warehouse.
   ```bash
   python etl_script.py
   ```

5. **Visualize the Data**: Open Tableau or Power BI and connect to the data warehouse to start creating visualizations.
